# 🎬 IMDb Movies Dataset Analysis

## 📖 Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the IMDb Movies dataset using Python's Pandas library. The goal is to demonstrate various data manipulation techniques, including data importing, cleansing, aggregation, and visualization. By leveraging the powerful features of Pandas, the project aims to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Import and Explore Data**
   - Load the IMDb Movies dataset from a JSON file into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Perform initial exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.

2. **Perform Data Cleansing**
   - Clean the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns and renaming columns for clarity.
   - Handle missing values and ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.

3. **Use Pandas to Create Histograms for Distribution Analysis**
   - Analyze the distribution of key numerical features using histograms.

4. **Practice: Distribution Analysis using Pandas and Histograms**
   - Apply various Pandas functions to conduct a detailed distribution analysis.

5. **Create Line Charts and Bar Charts to Visualize Time**
   - Visualize trends over time with line charts.
   - Use bar charts to compare categorical data.

6. **Use Pandas to Create Scatter Plots for Correlation Analysis**
   - Identify correlations between different numerical features using scatter plots.

7. **Practice: Data Visualization and Analysis**
   - Engage in further data visualization techniques to derive insights from the dataset.
